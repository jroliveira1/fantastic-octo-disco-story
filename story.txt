There once was a man named Austin, his luscious locks hung down to his knees.
He lived in Jamaica, with all his rasta brothers. Everyday they would walk
down to the beach to visit the lovely mermen that would swoon over them.

The mermen named Bowie. He lived in the sea for 19 years. Austin can still remember the first day he saw him. That day Austin went to beach to daze. He looked at the cursed pearl in his hands and felt delighted. He had always hated palm-fringed Kingston with its bored, boiled beach. It was a place that encouraged his tendency to feel blue. Then he saw something in the distance, or rather someone. It was the figure of Bowie. Bowie was an optimistic monster with handsome skin and brown hair. Austin gulped. He glanced at his own reflection. Bowie was a sinister, sweet, smart water drinker with beautiful skin and vast hair. People saw him as a melodic, moaning mermen. Austin knew him, Bowie. Bowie had once jumped into a river and saved a colossal Austin’s friends’ mother. But not even a sinister person who had once jumped into a river and saved a colossal  Austin’s friends’ mother, was prepared for what Bowie had on beach today.
