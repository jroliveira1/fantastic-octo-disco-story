There once was a man named Austin, his luscious locks hung down to his knees.
He lived in Jamaica, with all his rasta brothers. Everyday they would walk
down to the beach to visit the lovely mermen that would swoon over them.

Austin was just all beauty, he was wastly intelligent, cause he was a  cs major. He could virtually program his was out of anything. 

The mermen named Bowie. He lived in the sea for 19 years. Austin can still remember the first day he saw him. That day Austin went to beach to daze. He looked at the cursed pearl in his hands and felt delighted. He had always hated palm-fringed Kingston with its bored, boiled beach. It was a place that encouraged his tendency to feel blue. Then he saw something in the distance, or rather someone. It was the figure of Bowie. Bowie was an optimistic monster with handsome skin and brown hair. Austin gulped. He glanced at his own reflection. Bowie was a sinister, sweet, smart water drinker with beautiful skin and vast hair. People saw him as a melodic, moaning mermen. Austin knew him, Bowie. Bowie had once jumped into a river and saved a colossal Austin’s friends’ mother. But not even a sinister person who had once jumped into a river and saved a colossal  Austin’s friends’ mother, was prepared for what Bowie had on beach today.

As Austin reached the beach on that fateful day, he was greeted by a long carpet of red sea kelp strewn on the beach leading to the waters edge, right where he would normally meet Bowie. Tentativly he began to follow the red kelp carpet towards the water's edge. As he neared the water, he began to hear a soft song of the sea being sung by a chorus of mermen, suddenly he saw bowie rise from the water, and with a soft swoon utter the words, "Austin my love if you hate this place so, crush that pearl under foot, and become my partner in Atlantis for life.
